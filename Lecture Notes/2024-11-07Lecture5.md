## Correlation, Causation, Statistics

#### Example: Cholesterol and Statins
Study from 70s correlated heart-disease with average fat consumption in diet. Graph looked really well fit 
(high R value) except they had removed some data points.

Measure dependence between two variables using correlation measure:

corr(X, Y) = cov(X, Y) / (sigma_X * sigma_Y), where cov(X,Y) = E[(X - mu_X)(Y - mu_Y)]
corr(X, Y) $\in$ [-1, 1]
corr(X, Y) = 0 => X and Y are independent. \
Correlation was devised with linear relationship in mind. It does not model other relationships well.

#### Correlation does not imply causation
- 2 variables (Global Average Temperature & Number of Pirates) can be strongly correlated to a third one (time).
- Divorce rate in South Carolina vs Honey producing bee colonies (R = 0.904)
These relations were not hypothesized first and investigated after. Instead, they were found by looking for
strong correlations. This means the real problem is not the data/numbers, but it is the process (behind the figure).

## Why do we need to visualize ?
Vastly different datasets can give the same statistical measures (mean, correlation, slope, etc...).Visualize the 
datasets to see the data and see if there is an issue with the data.
