# Lecture 10 (12/12 2024)

Summing up the lectures on DoE (Design of Experiments, see [5_design_of_experiments.pdf](5_design_of_experiments.pdf)).

1. Investigate whether there is any impact by parameters on result (represent all corners of the hypercube in $\!R^{d}$ where $d$ is the number of parameters). Conclude which parameters have an impact.
2. Quantify the impact of the parameters found in (1).
3. D-optimal, A-optimal, etc... 

[A first example](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/lectures/lecture_bayesian_statistics_introduction.pdf) cool coin example from lecture.

### problem 1 solved:
1 fair coin and 1 double-headed coin: What is the probability that the coin is the two-headed one?\
$P(2-headed|HHHHHHHH) = \frac{P(HHHHHHHH|2-headed) * P(2-headed)}{P(HHHHHHHH)}$\
$=\frac{1*\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}*\frac{1}{2^8}+\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{256}{256+1} \approx 0.996$ ok

### problem 2:
999 fair coins and 1 double-headed coin:\
$\frac{P(HHHHHHHH|2-headed) * P(2-headed)}{P(HHHHHHHH)} = \frac{1*\frac{1}{1000}}{\frac{999}{1000}*\frac{1}{2^8}+\frac{1}{1000}} $
$= \frac{1}{\frac{999}{256}+1} \approx 0.204 ok$

___
$BIC (M) = k ln(n) - 2 ln (\widehat{L(M)})$ 

$AIC (M) = 2k - 2ln(L)$
___
Lasso and ridge regression, slightly different loss functions that give different (compared to 'classic' least-squares regression) results.

### One-armed bandit problem:

2 slot machines A and B giving return $R_i \in (-1, 1)$ completely at random. Maximize $\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_i$. How?
