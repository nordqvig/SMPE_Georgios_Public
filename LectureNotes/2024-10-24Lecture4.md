# Lecture 4 (24/10) 

### Personal data

Data that can be used to (directly OR indirectly) identify a person. 
The processing of _sensitive_ personal data is forbidden.

### _Data management plan_ is a written document describing
- research data you expet to generate
- The mechanism you will use
  - to manage
  - to describe
  - to analyze
  - to store
- mechanism after project to
  - analyze data
  - share data

Aim for having DMP:
- time efficiency
- reproducibility
- conduct safe research

Write the data management plan before you start research to save time and headache. See the miro.com board 
for an example of what a DMP could look like. 

A large part of todays lecture went into working on and discussing the miro.com board. I thought a lot about the points 
under the following headline: "Data description and collection or re-use of existing data"
- When starting a project, it is important to consider what kind of data you will be collecting, and if you will be re-using data
  - So that you can implement appropriate measures for storage

### Takeaway:

There are many important questions to ask yourself when starting a project. Ideally you want to ask yourself these 
questions upfront, so that they don't cause issues later on. The answers to these questions vary a lot depending on the 
project at hand. 

A good example of reproducible research: https://github.com/cboettig/noise-phenomena

### File organization:
#### Names matter: use underscores!
#### Snakecase for python variables: this_is_a_variable_name (a bit long perhaps)

Filenames: should play well with default ordering (so that ls display in logical order)
- numeric first
- yyyy-mm-dd for dates
- left pad numbers with 0
