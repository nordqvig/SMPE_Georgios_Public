# Photo Enhancement Technology 
#### To prepare for my presentation on Photo Enhancement technology, I will brainstorm talking points here.

Material: https://cacm.acm.org/news/filtering-for-beauty/

You will present 
- 1 the problems it tries to 
- 2 to what extent it does
- 3 whether it unlocked other usages/problems. 
- 4 Indicate in which of the 4th scenarios of the ADEME (https://transitions2050.ademe.fr/en) this technology is rooted.

### The problem it tries to address

Augmented reality beauty filters allow people to modify their appearance in photos and video. This can allow them to 
project an image they are more confident with and to create more visually appealing content.   

### To what extent it does

The technology itself is very well-developed. There are filters for reducing dark spots, scars, birthmarks, blemishes, etc...
Augmented reality filters can also alter colors, lighting, contrast and many other image properties. They can even 
change the size of certain features, allowing you for example a smaller nose or bigger eyes. So when it comes to the 
capabilities of the technology itself, it is very capable of doing what "we want it to". However there are problems 
arising from its use...

### Resulting other usages/problems

- mental-health: beauty filters result in unrealistic expectations on appearances, particularly affecting young girls 

+ trying on products: cosmetic company websites can allow you to try a product by proposing a beauty-filter that gives 
the same result
