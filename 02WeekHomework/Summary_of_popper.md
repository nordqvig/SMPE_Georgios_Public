### Summary of Popper's [Text](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2024_10_Grenoble/02_reading_Popper_Conjectures-and-refutation.pdf)

In the text, Popper discusses four significant theories of the year 1919:
- Einstein's Theory of Relativity
- Marx's Theory on History
- Freud's Psycho-analysis 
- Adler's individual psychology

Popper remarks upon the difference between Einstein's theory compared to the other three theories. The idea that refutability 
is essential for a scientific theory to be considered valid is presented. Popper illustrates this by arguing that in the cases of 
Marx, Freud, and Adler, a strong believer of any one of these theories has no problem explaining any observed behavior 
by means of their theory. Thus, these theories are not refutable, and this makes them weak scientific theories. He summarizes
his criteria, to be imposed on any theory wishing to call itself scientific, in a number of bullet points. Number 3 reads as such:
"Every "good" scientific theory is a prohibition: it forbids certain things to happen. The more a theory forbids, the better it is."
This is, in my view, the essence of Popper's ideas. Popper goes on to explain how the three irrefutable theories came to be
irrefutable. Finally, he points out that although the two psycho-analytic theories aren't refutable, they aren't
necessarily unimportant. However, they cannot claim to be supported by empirical evidence the way that a refutable scientific theory
can.
