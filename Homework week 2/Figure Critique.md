Criticize every figure of Jean-Marc’s slides by:
  - Applying the checklist for good graphics;
  - Proposing a better representation (hand-drawing is fine) that passes the checklist.
- Report this work for at least 3 figures on you github/gitlab project.


## XRP/EUR figure (pdf page 29)

![XRPEUR figure](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/storage/user/13601/files/6f533889-27be-4fc6-aa4e-4577ed494929)


- **Data**: is presented well. All the applicable checkboxes are checked.
- **Graphical objects**: Everything ok except the following:
  - :heavy_minus_sign: The graphical axis are not well labelled and the scales and units are not explicit.
- **Annotations**: Annotations are okay and in line with expectations on this graph.
- **Information**: Information presented is ok, ticks all boxes.
- **Context**: Some points hard to evaluate without surround text, but all in all okay.
- **Elegance**: The graph is **not** elegant.

Possible improvements would be to label the axis and include scales and units. However, when it comes to financial graphs 
they usually look like this and I would say this figure is appropriate for a financially literate target audience. 

## Catastrophes Naturelles (pdf page 30)

- **Data**: These checkboxes are all okay. Appropriate choice of graphic to show historical curve.
- **Graphical objects**: There is actually nothing wrong with the graphics of this figure. Colors etc. all work well.
- **Annotations**:  
  - :heavy_minus_sign: The axis are not labelled. The x-axis years are self-explanatory and justify not using (0,0) origin. 
- **Information**: Information presented is ok, ticks all boxes.
- **Context**: Substantial shortcomings in this regard. The title being the biggest problem.
  - :heavy_minus_sign: The figure does not specify the scope of the phrase "catastrophes naturelles" which means, as a standalone figure, the graph doesn't give much information. 
- **Elegance**: The graph is quite elegant. It's neat, tidy, and concise. 

## Temperature cooling scheme figure

![Temperature cooling scheme](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/geonor/SMPE2024Georgios/blob/main/Homework%20week%202/Alpha%20values%20figure.png?raw=true)

- **Data**: No confidence intervals. Unclear how the curves are built 
- **Graphical objects**: Colors are fine. However, there are no labels on axis, no units, and the two dottes lines are a bit too similar.
- **Annotations**:  
  - :heavy_minus_sign: Axis are not labelled by quantities, no units. Each curve has a legend but unclear which legend is for which curve (dotted curves).
- **Information**: Ticks most boxes, although it's very unclear what information is given to the reader. 
- **Context**: Big problems here, since the graphic is not at all self-explanatory. Very unclear what the cooling scheme is or what alpha is etc. 
- **Elegance**: The graph is **not** elegant at all. Very plain and minimal.
